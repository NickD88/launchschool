#the above is shortened as ruby will return a boolean value when statements are made
#there is no need to evaluate to true or false

#shortened verision of the below:

# def color_valid(color)
#   if color == "blue" || color == "green"
#     true
#   else
#     false
#   end
# end
# def color_valid(color)
#   if color == "blue" || color == "green"
#     true
#   else
#     false
#   end
# end
